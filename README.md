## Download

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/rodrigosambadesaa/Kotlin-Pokedex/releases) to download the latest available apk.

## Connectivity policy

Before starting a network operation, the app performs a cheap local check using
`ConnectivityAndInternetAccess.isConnected()` (or the passive `NetworkObserver` state).
When no usable network exists, network work is skipped and the local Pokémon asset is used.
When a network exists, the app starts the real Retrofit or Glide operation directly; those
operations retain their own timeouts and exception handling. A general active connectivity
diagnostic is run only after a network-shaped failure such as DNS, route, timeout, or TLS
failure. HTTP responses are handled as service responses and do not trigger that diagnostic.
